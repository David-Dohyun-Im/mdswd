tl;dr

programming is changing

1/ programming is at an inflection point

programming language productivity is increasing exponentially, driven by ai

claude code

ibm 029 (1964)
For programming punch cards

ed (1969)
First text based editor, Ken Thompson of Bell Labs

smalltalk-80 (1980)
First IDE with a GUI, live editing

visual basic (1991)
First mainstream visual editor

eclipse (2001)
3P plugin ecosystem, rich autocomplete

copilot (2021)
Multi-line AI-powered autocomplete

devin (2024)
Conversation-first, moving away from directly manipulating code

ide devx has evolved quickly, and will continue to change even more quickly

verification is evolving quickly, too

manual debugging
static types (algol)
formal verification
abstract interpretation
automated testing
continuous integration
property-based testing (quickcheck)
dependent typing
e2e testing
chaos testing (chaos monkey)
ai-powered vulnerability testing
ai-powered unit testing (testgen)
ai-powered fuzz testing (sapienz)
self play

2/ claude code’s approach

claude code’s approach:
works everywhere

terminal-native
low-level model access
infinitely hackable


18
1. Discover 
2. Design 
3. Build
4. Deploy 
5. Support & Scale
Explore codebase and history
Search documentation
Onboard & learn
Plan project
Develop tech specs
Define architecture
Implement code
Write and execute tests
Create commits and PRs
Automate CI/CD
Configure environments
Manage deployments
Debug errors
Large-scale refactor
Monitor usage & performance
Using and mastering all of your team’s CLI tools (e.g., git, docker, bq) so you can focus on solutions, not syntax
works across the whole sdlc

3/ one ✻code, many faces

4/ using claude code

use cases

1. codebase q&a + research
2. write code
   a. 1-shot
   b. sidekick
   c. prototype
3. integrate tools & mcps
4. power automation


1. ask claude code about your code

> how do I make a new @app/services/ValidationTemplateFactory?
> why does recoverFromException take so many arguments? look through git history to answer
> why did we fix issue #18363 by adding the if/else in @src/login.ts api?
> in which version did we release the new @api/ext/PreHooks.php api?
> look at PR #9383, then carefully verify which app versions were impacted
> what did I ship last week?


2. teach claude to use your tools


> use the barley cli to check for error logs


$ claude mcp add barley_server -- node myserver
> use the barley mcp server to check for error logs


3. fit the workflow to the task



explore › plan › confirm › code › commit
> figure out the root cause for issue #983, then propose a few fixes. Let me choose an approach before you code. ultrathink

3. fit the workflow to the task



tests › commit › code › iterate › commit
> write tests for @utils/markdown.ts to make sure links render properly (note the tests won’t pass yet, since links aren’t yet implemented). then commit. then update the code to make the tests pass.

3. fit the workflow to the task



code › screenshot › iterate
> implement [mock.png]. Then screenshot it with puppeteer and iterate till it looks like the mock.




4. use claude code to prototype




> make it so instead of todos showing up as they come in, we hide the tool use and result for todos, and render a fixed todo list above the input. title it "/todo (1 of 3)" in grey

> actually don't show a todo list at all, and instead render the tool uses inline, as bold headings when the model starts working on a todo. keep the "step 2 of 4" or whatever, and add middot /todo to see after in grey

> also add a todo pill under the text input, similar to bg tasks. it should render "todos: 1 of 3" or whatever. make the pill interactive

> actually undo both the pill and headings. instead, make the todo list render to the right of the input, vertically centered with a grey divider. show it when todos are active, hide it when it's done

> actually what if you show the todo list above the input instead. truncate at 5 and show "... and 4 more" or whatever. add a heading "Todo:" in grey text

> actually what if you show the todo list above the input instead. truncate at 5 and show "... and 4 more" or whatever. add a heading "Todo:" in grey text

> actually what if you show the todo list above the input instead. truncate at 5 and show "... and 4 more" or whatever. add a heading "Todo:" in grey text

> instead of showing todos above the input, merge them into the spinner. show the current todo as the spinner message in active verb form, and the next todo instead of the spinner tip, in passive form. also add a /todos slash command to see all todos, and mention it next to "esc to interrupt"

> make it so i can hit ctrl+t to expand todos inline. also rm the "esc to interrupt" message when we show the todos, and replace it w "ctrl+t to expand"


6/ lessons

1. build for the model six months from now


2. be ready to evolve


3. ask not what the model can do for you


4.
Models gets better, compute gets cheaper

thanks!
