Building a breakout AI developer product
themodernsoftware.dev
Use warp as the demonstration tool

Why
We’re seeing some of the fastest adoption of new dev tools in history


themodernsoftware.dev


Why
The UX/UI for developer tools are changing rapidly to best leverage agentic autonomy 
What does having agents in your developer environment change about the product you are using?

7 Product Principles of Modern AI Dev Tools
themodernsoftware.dev
How many people use the terminal here?
Show the native mac terminal app
Let’s bring it all together

Start with what developers know
themodernsoftware.dev
Encourage transition from existing interfaces
Everyone uses an IDE (Cursor)
Terminal is well-understood UX (Warp)
People know chat (Bolt)
Easily switch between code and natural language
https://explainshell.com/explain as a starting point
Align behind a shared universal painpoint
“Tar -czvf” example
Weaning off the commandline interface



Configuration flexibility
themodernsoftware.dev
Zero setup required to demonstrate value for average user
Swap between models seamlessly
Tremendous configurability for power user
Prompts
Project rules
MCP
Warp profiles per user 



Focus on developer ergonomics
themodernsoftware.dev
If you can shave off a single keystroke, do it
Keyboard hotkeys 
Zero onboarding friction
“5 minutes to WOW”
Stickiness of “tab”, “enter” features


Chat as a first-class citizen
themodernsoftware.dev
Code is inherently a contrived representation of human intent
As tools evolve, more of them will involve just speaking in natural language
Progress toward simply communicating developer intent rather than syntax
Debugging an error in Warp



MCP Integration
themodernsoftware.dev
MCP has become the lingua franca for allowing LLMs to interact with the real-world 
Extensible tool ecosystem to give LLMs access to any resource and ability to do anything
Show how Warp integrates with MCP
Show example of using context7 for up-to-date braintrust



Rapid feedback loops	
themodernsoftware.dev
Allow iterating on changes and seeing updates quickly
Panels and dashboards that change in near real-time based on prompts
This is why entire projects are committed to just reducing build time
Explainability is first-class citizen

Real-time update canvas in Bolt/Lovable
Warp take action and immediate reaction to that action
You see the effects of your changes



Agent Workflows
themodernsoftware.dev
Full autonomy for substantive tasks
Increasing adoption of an “agent-take-the-wheel” approach
Varied levels of human-in-the-loop involvement
Agent asks clarifying questions
YOLO
Show yolo mode in Warp



Open Questions
themodernsoftware.dev
Will we see massive consolidation from point solutions (for code review, app building, monitoring) into a single all-in-one platform?
Will AI IDEs just evolve into AI terminals into AI browser replits? 
Will tools like Warp/Cursor become more verticalized, specializing their offering for tasks like full stack development?
What universal standard will emerge for personalizing your coding agents and giving them project-specific rules? 
We won’t be in a fragmented .cursorrules / CLAUDE.md / etc world for long.
AGENTS.md is a first step in that direction
