How to be an Agent Manager  
themodernsoftware.dev

Why
Development evolution
Single developer managing single developer’s output
Lead managing many developers worth of output
Lead managing many developers worth of output (assisted by an AI system)
Single developer managing many AI agents worth of work

A brief history of software teams
themodernsoftware.dev
Mainstream adoption of software teams, specialization emerges

First software teams emerge driven by requirements of NASA, DoD projects


1940
2030
2025
Teams with developers managing groups of diverse agents

2023
Software teams with developers assisted by AI coding systems

1960
Solo developers handling full projects

1970
1990


Goals
themodernsoftware.dev
….
Every developer operates as a tech lead controlling their own army of agents handling specialized tasks (PR, quality assurance, etc), languages (react, fastapi python, svelte), role responsibilities (data engineer, ml engineer, devops)
Eventually a moderately technical PM will be able to do the same thing


Software task steps
themodernsoftware.dev
Provide high level requirements 🟩
Convert requirements into a design doc 🟩/🟦
Implement solution from doc 🟦
Add tests 🟦
Ensure CI (continuous integration) passes 🟦
Code review 🟦
Update docs 🟦 
Breakdown of typical tasks and who is responsible for what: green is human, blue is agent

Techniques for directing agents
themodernsoftware.dev
Agent behavior files (Claude.md/Cursorrules/agents.md)
Hooks
Commands
Subagents

See examples of all of these IRL



Hooks
Deterministic scripts that run on predefined event types
PreToolUse
PostToolUse
UserPromptSubmit
PreCompact
…and more
themodernsoftware.dev
Provide a sample


Commands
Provide frequently-used prompts as files that the agent can execute
Use cases
Running tests
Reviewing code
Form a git commit, push
themodernsoftware.dev
Provide a sample
Ship-it command in claude code

Subagents
Runtime delegation
Purposes of a subagent is to
Create distinct developer personas for different types of work (frontend, backend, etc)
Cleanly separate contexts for different work streams
Offer
Customized system prompts, tools, and a separate context window
A move toward agents managing other agents
Use cases

Compare to Claude.md files which are more about anchoring behavior

You need careful backstops	
Tests in codebase
CI/CD best practices
Auditability of each agent
Label every diff made by an agent 
Different models for different classes of tasks
More complex tasks you may need to handhold a bit more upfront vs fully async ones
Checkpoint (commit) regularly 

themodernsoftware.dev
Best practices
Different models for different tasks
Opus for planning, sonnet as a workhorse

How can we automate the first 10-20% research phase of any task?
How to maintain a queue of pending tasks (easier for 1-off changes)?
