AI Code Review
themodernsoftware.dev

themodernsoftware.dev


Software code review is one of the highest leverage activities you can do to become a better engineer and improve overall team code quality


Why
themodernsoftware.dev


Statistics
Code review has 55-60% error detection rate compared to 25-45% for different testing modes
Study of errors on programs without/with code review reported 4.5 → 0.82 errors/100 lines
Study at AT&T showed code review had 14% increase in productivity and 90% decrease in defects

Idioms in your codebase
Database access patterns (i.e. use this service rather than a direct DB lookup)

Helps team members adapt their mental model of the system as it’s changing
Ensures the change correctly solves the problem
Opens discussion for strengths and weaknesses of a design
Catches bugs before they get to production
Keeps the code style and organization consistent


What’s a Good Code Review
themodernsoftware.dev
This won’t work
vs
I see your new method matches the existing style in this file, taking [X] parameters. Having that many parameters hurts readability and implies the function is doing too much. What do you think about refactoring this method and the existing ones in a later pull request to reduce how many parameters they take?
Provides specific details.
References specific code or issues.
Suggests a resolution to the problem.
Cites evidence or provides an explanation

What Has Changed
themodernsoftware.dev
Efficiency 
Consistency	
Knowledge sharing	
Reduced cognitive load
Continuous improvement
Holistic understanding of your code

Automation reduces review time and catches issues early
Developers learn best practices through AI suggestions
AI applies the same standards across all code reviews
AI handles routine checks, letting humans focus on complex logic
AI systems improve over time with more data
modern AI code review tools go deeper, offering contextual analysis and pattern recognition

Let’s See AI Code Review in Action
themodernsoftware.dev
Graphite example
Developers learn best practices through AI suggestions
AI applies the same standards across all code reviews
AI handles routine checks, letting humans focus on complex logic
AI systems improve over time with more data
modern AI code review tools go deeper, offering contextual analysis and pattern recognition


Limitations
themodernsoftware.dev
More configuration/setup
False positives
Have to train the system → continuous learning
Can’t yet catch the idioms and repo best practices
Can’t handle complex business logic and architecture decisions
But that’s where humans are still needed
Must be extra cautious with security changes
Often misses edge cases
Code review is more important now than ever with AI coding systems
You own the code that is merged and shipped, no blaming of the AI
Need to explicitly tell it what not to review and aspects of your code patterns/idioms
Be especially mindful of user input, authentication, file operations, network requests
