App Builder Architecture

WebContainer
Webcontainer running arbitrary generated code


App Builder System Prompt


themodernsoftware.dev
Explicitly requests only established, well-known technologies/frameworks
https://gist.github.com/curran/753aa62fd99b7df8f858743d605f1d02
https://app.prompthub.us/prompthub/bolt-agent-system-prompt
boltartifact/Boltaction to designate things that should happen (file creation, file running, etc) in the webcontainer


Limitations
Everything is awesome when it works but once things break we’re back at square 1
Prompts are just suggestions. Not every user understands that
Security has been an issue in the past
How do we prevent all these apps from looking the same?
How complex can these apps realistically get?
