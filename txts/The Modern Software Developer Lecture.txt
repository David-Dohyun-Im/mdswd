Local, Synchronous
Cloud, Asynchronous

Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

sync: single-threaded, human-in-the-loop, your attention is focused on one task=> AI agent works for 20 seconds - 1.5 minutes



Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

sync: single-threaded, human-in-the-loop, your attention is focused on one task=> AI agent works for 20 seconds - 1.5 minutes

async: multi-threaded, human delegates to AI, switches attention between multiple tasks=> AI agent works for 10 minutes - multiple hours

How Devin delivers workflow autonomy
Plan — engineer in the loop • Ask Devin questions in Search / Wiki to surface the right files, APIs, tests • Clarify scope → Devin writes a step-by-step plan • Time cost ≈ minutes
Build — Devin in the loop • Devin spins up its isolated workspace (shell + editor + browser) • Plans → executes → tests → iterates until the task is green • Runs fully async; you move on to other work
Review — engineer back in the loop • Devin opens a clean PR with passing tests and a change summary • You review, comment, or merge — Devin can revise on request • Human effort ≲ 15 % of the original task
Result: one clear hand-off, 6-12× engineer leverage, zero IDE disruption.

Using async agents is a hard but learnable skill
Managing async agents can unlock 10x gains……but most people use sync agents.

Managing async agents can unlock 10x gains……but most people use sync agents.
Why?
Turns out management & delegation is a difficult skill to master – whether it’s humans or agents.
Requires ability to cycle between multiple tasks and quickly understanding new context

Delegate the coding to the agent

Testing the agent’s changes
Common workflow:1. Delegate task to Devin (async)2. Test & refine changes in Windsurf (sync)

Future outlook:If async agents could test autonomously, the leverage increases.This is slowly starting to become a reality.
